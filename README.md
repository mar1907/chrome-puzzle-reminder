# Chrome Puzzle Reminder
My little experiment creating a small Google Chrome extension with the Chrome API while also creating something useful for me - a customizable daily reminder to play some daily games (like Wordle).

Inspiration: [Water Alarm](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.water_alarm_notification)

## Installation
Clone this repo and use 'Load Unpacked Extension'.
